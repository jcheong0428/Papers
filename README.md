Concepts in Neuroscience, 1, 27-51.](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nQk5Pv9kf-YC&oi=fnd&pg=PA367&dq=The+social+brain:+A+project+for+integrating+primate+behavior+and+neurophysiology+in+a+new+domain&ots=ry9Y3HCdex&sig=oinllCEv6ao3wYBwaF-b6SBmkeM#v=twopage&q&f=true)
- social cognition: processing information for accurate perception of disposition & intentions of other individuals.
- argues that social cognition is a special domain. evolution from olfaction to vision for social communication accompanied increased complexity in social structure; communication of internal state through face and expressions.
- social knowledge is unique than other knowledge. social knowledge-related impairments in autistic children
- neurological syndromes that impair social perception
  - Patient EVR: OFC lesion, lost ability to respond appropriately in social situations.
  - Capgras syndrome: thinking the person is a imposter
  - paranoid psychoses: distorted thoughts of other's intentions
- Humans can experience many diverse affects.
  - purple is not a combination of feeling red and blue
  - richness of complex emotions
    - people often describe emotion "as if I were in such-such situation"
- Amygdaloid simulations - stimulate emotional memories.

Q. Is there a study where you compare brain representation of emotions from situation described vs label vs facial emotion?

- Original idea Byrne and Whiten : Machiavellian Intelligence hypothesis  but  adopted Social Brain Hypothesis because less contentious.

# Emotion Convergence & social connection
[Anderson, C., Keltner, D., & John, O. P. (2003). Emotional convergence between people over time. Journal of personality and social psychology, 84(5), 1054.](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.320.1184&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
- dating partners, college roommates became more similar in their emotional responses over the course of a year.
- Relationships whose partners were more emotionally similar were less likely to break up.

[Schachter, S. (1959). The psychology of affiliation: Experimental studies of the sources of gregariousness.](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1959-10111-000)
- People who are under anxiety want to wait with other people who are participating in the same experiment than alone.
- Participants would rather wait with those who are about to participate in same experiment than wait with others who are waiting for something else. (N=10 for each condition...)

[Hatfield, E., Cacioppo, J. T., & Rapson, R. L. (1994). Emotional contagion: Studies in emotion and social interaction. Editions de la Maison des sciences de l’homme.](https://lyi07mfsx01.storage.googleapis.com/MDUyMTQ0OTQ4MA==01.pdf)

- compared to subjects who watch an emotionally neutral film, subjects who watch an emotionally arousing film have increased pain thresholds and an increased sense of group bonding

[Bruder, M., Dosmukhambetova, D., Nerb, J., & Manstead, A. S. (2012). Emotional signals in nonverbal interaction: Dyadic facilitation and convergence in expressions, appraisals, and feelings. Cognition & emotion, 26(3), 480-502.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2011.645280)
- facilitation and convergence are not uniform across different emotions and emotion components.
- friends’ appraisals of an amuse- ment film were more correlated than those of strangers, but only if the partners could not see each other
- friend > stranger, number of smiles to amusing film.
- strong convergence in amusement-related expressions among friends who were visible to each other. This convergence was moderated by the amount of attention directed at the partner and by the level of social motives.
- Convergence measured by intraclass correlation - correlation of number of smiling within pair and outside pair.
- Social motives - degree to which they thought about the other person.

# Sharing of Emotion
[Rimé, B. (2009). Emotion elicits the social sharing of emotion: Theory and empirical review. Emotion review, 1(1), 60-85.](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1754073908097189)

- Negative & positive emotions instigate conversations.
- Also touches on the temporal aspects of memory sharing.

- Experimental evidence that when exposed to emotionally arousing movies, participants talk more about it than less arousing movies.

## Depression
Gibbons, F. X. (1986). Social comparison and depression: Company's effect on misery. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51(1), 140.
- depressed subjects prefer information from subjects who are also experiencing negative affect, but not when they feel positive.

Rosenblatt, A., & Greenberg, J. (1991). Examining the world of the
depressed: Do depressed people prefer others who are depressed? Journal
of Personality and Social Psychology, 60, 620–629.
- best friends of depressed people more depressed bfs of non-depressed.
- dep-dep, dep-nondep, nondep-nondep subjects had conversations, but no difference in liking.

# fMRI
## Individual Differences
[Feilong, M., Nastase, S. A., Guntupalli, J. S., & Haxby, J. V. (2018). Reliable individual differences in fine-grained cortical functional architecture. bioRxiv, 296012.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918307274)
- Using hyperalignment to see if individual differences persist after alignment compared to anatomical alignment. Participants viewed Raiders of Lost Ark. Hyperalignment using separate 11 subjects, derived transformation from first half of movie from the 20 subjects. Uses searchlight, grabs TR x time matrix, flattens it as the "response profile" which was correlated across subjects to create intersubject similarity matrix at each searchlight. Two searchlights (first half of second-half of movie v second half of second-half of movie) were compared as a measure of reliability.
Using hyperalignment increased reliability in 82%.



# Stats
## LMER
[Harrison, X. A., Donaldson, L., Correa-Cano, M. E., Evans, J., Fisher, D. N., Goodwin, C. E., ... & Inger, R. (2018). A brief introduction to mixed effects modelling and multi-model inference in ecology. PeerJ, 6, e4794.](https://peerj.com/articles/4794/#p-16)
- A good set of recommendations on how to use LMER.  


# Replication
[Evaluating the replicability of social science experiments in Nature and Science between 2010 and 2015. (2018). Camerer et al. ](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4hmb6/)
- 13/21 (62%) studies replicated, effect size is half of original.
- Peer beliefs about replicability a strong predictor of actual replication.

[Evaluating replicability of laboratory experiments in economics (2016)/ Camerer et al. ](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6280/1433)
- 11/18 (61%) studies replicated, effect size is about 2/3 of original.
- Prediction market allso a good predictor of replication.
